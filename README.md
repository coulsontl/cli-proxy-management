## How to Use

### 1. Using After CLI Proxy API Program Launch (Recommended)
Once the CLI Proxy API program is up and running, you can access the WebUI at `http://your-server-IP:8317/management.html`.

### 2. Direct Use
Simply open the `index.html` file directly in your browser to use it.

### 3. Use a Local Server

#### Option A: Using Node.js (npm)
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the server on the default port (3000)
npm start
```

#### Option B: Using Python
```bash
# Python 3.x
python -m http.server 8000

```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

### 3. Configure Connection
1. Open the management interface.
2. On the login screen, enter:
   - **Remote Address**: The current version automatically picks up the remote address from where you're connecting. But you can also set your own address if you prefer.
   - **Management Key**: Your management key
3. Click the "Connect" button.
4. Once connected successfully, all features will be available.
